# 📈 Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Project

## 🌟 Overview
This project aims to analyze historical stock market data, predict future stock prices using machine learning models, and perform sentiment analysis on news headlines and social media posts. Additionally, it leverages **Ollama**, a powerful language model, to interpret stock charts based on technical analysis. The insights generated from this project can help investors, traders, and financial analysts make informed decisions.

Code Walkthrough
Key Functions
Fetching Stock Data:
```
def fetch_stock_data(ticker, period, interval):
    data = yf.download(ticker, period=period, interval=interval)
    return data
```
Fetches historical stock data using Yahoo Finance (yfinance).

Adding Technical Indicators:
```
def add_technical_indicators(data):
    data['SMA_20'] = ta.trend.sma_indicator(data['Close'], window=20)
    data['EMA_20'] = ta.trend.ema_indicator(data['Close'], window=20)
    return data
```
Adds SMA and EMA to the stock data for technical analysis.

Sentiment Analysis:
```
def get_sentiment_analysis(tickers, start_date, end_date):
    # Fetch news headlines and classify sentiment using a few-shot model
    return sentiment_data
```
Uses a pre-trained few-shot learning model to classify sentiment.

Ollama Integration:
```
def analyze_chart_with_ollama(ticker, chart_data):
    # Generate chart and send to Ollama for analysis
    response = ollama.chat(model='llama3.2-vision', messages=messages)
    return response["message"]["content"]
```
Sends stock charts to Ollama for interpretation and recommendations.

Few-Shot Learning for Sentiment Analysis
Overview
The few-shot learning model is used to classify sentiment from news headlines and social media posts. It is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce, as it can generalize well with only a few examples.

## Model Training
The few-shot learning model is trained on a small dataset of labeled news headlines. Here's how the training process works:

Prepare the Dataset:

Collect a small dataset of news headlines labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

Example dataset format:


Title, Sentiment
"Apple stock hits record high after earnings report", Positive
"Tesla faces production delays", Negative
"Microsoft announces new AI tools", Neutral
Train the Model:

Use a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT, BERT) and fine-tune it on the labeled dataset.

Example code for training:

from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained model
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")

# Define candidate labels
candidate_labels = ["Positive", "Negative", "Neutral"]

# Train the model on a few examples
training_data = [
    {"text": "Apple stock hits record high after earnings report", "label": "Positive"},
    {"text": "Tesla faces production delays", "label": "Negative"},
    {"text": "Microsoft announces new AI tools", "label": "Neutral"},
]

for example in training_data:
    classifier(example["text"], candidate_labels=candidate_labels)
Save the Model:

Save the trained model for future use:

import joblib
joblib.dump(classifier, 'few_shot_model.pkl')
Load and Use the Model:

Load the trained model and use it for sentiment analysis:

loaded_few_shot_clf = joblib.load('few_shot_model.pkl')
sentiment = loaded_few_shot_clf("Apple stock hits record high after earnings report", candidate_labels=candidate_labels)
print(sentiment)


## Example Outputs
1. Portfolio Performance Chart
   Portfolio Performance

2. Sentiment Analysis Table
Ticker	Date	Title	Sentiment
AAPL	2023-10-01	Apple stock hits record high after earnings	Positive
TSLA	2023-10-02	Tesla faces production delays	Negative
3. Ollama Analysis

**AI Analysis Results:**
Recommendation: Buy
Reasoning: The stock chart shows a strong uptrend with the price consistently above the 20-day SMA and EMA. The RSI is below 70, indicating no overbought conditions. This suggests a good entry point for long-term investors.
